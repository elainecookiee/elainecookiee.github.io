	    <p>Arcadia Custom provides custom-made, luxury windows & doors to the high-end residential market. </p>

	    <p>They have a strong reputation in the architectural space for the quality and performance of their products. They wanted to create a digital experience that is an extension of the premium services they provide, while easing the home building process for their core audiences.</p>

		<p>A high-end, luxury experience that meet the needs for each persona group:</p>
	</br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Homeowners</strong> have difficulty visualizing how different customization and configuration options would match the style they’ve envisioned for their home. They would like to feel informed when making a large purchase and experience the quality of products before going to a physical showroom location.</li>
		</br>
			<li><strong>Professionals</strong> (Architects, Dealers and Builders) require technical documentation and 3D assets to be readily available. It is extremely frustrating for them to submit a manual request for every file they need and wait for a response.</li>

			<li>Option to toggle between general overview and technical specs when viewing specific products</li>
		</ul>

	<!-- Research & Discovery -->
	<div class="section">
	    <h2><span class="primary">RESEARCH & DISCOVERY</span></h2>
	    <p>In preparation for the Design Thinking Session (DTS), we had a 2-Week Research & Discovery Phase to understand the current competitive landscape, conduct interviews, create personas, user journeys and gather inspiration.</p>

	    <p><strong>Our Constraints</strong></p>
	    <p>Arcadia Custom has a network of over 140 high-end window and door dealers across the nation. A few members of our New York team had the opportunity to visit a facility in Stamford to conduct interviews.</p>
	    <p>We learned that:</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>Customers are sold on Arcadia Custom products before they come in by recommendations from pre-qualified architects and builders</li>
	    	<li>Customers immediately feel the value of the product upon touching it. They are always impressed with the build quality and weight. They are not price sensitive, they just want the best visual and design</li>
	    	<li>Every Arcadia Custom product is made to the specs of the house it will be installed in. Most of their competitors have standard sizes that architects/builders have to work around (24” x 36”)</li>
	    	<li>Arcadia Custom has a lead time of 12 weeks due to their national manufacturing presence. Most competitors have a lead time of 20-30 weeks with only one facility in the nation</li>
	    	<li>Their simulated steel product is their best seller. Priced like aluminum but looks like steel. Competitors imitate but Arcadia Custom has a superior product</li>
	    	<li>Each showroom location has different product offerings and product lines available</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>After the on-site visit, we were inspired to...</p>
	    <ol>
	    	<li>1) Capture the quality & flexibility of products offered by Arcadia Custom into the digital experience</li>
	    	<li>2) present Arcadia Custom as a partner in luxury home design rather than simply a window and door manufacturer</li>
	    </ol>

	    <img src="images/kinetic/onsite.png">
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	    <p><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></p>
	    <p>To better understand the competitive space, we examined how direct competitors met the needs of homeowners and professionals looking to use their products. Specifically taking note of the information architecture (overall ease of navigation), products (product detail page and specs) and process (inspiration gallery). </p>

	    <p>Overall, we found that top-level luxury brands in the window & door space lacked innovative, modern site experiences. We needed to lean on best practices and inspiration from brands at a lower level of luxury as well as parallel industries to craft an experience best suited for Arcadia Custom.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	    <p><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong></p>
	    <p>To gather insight from internal teams, we conducted 7 interviews with stakeholders across Arcadia Custom and DMC Global. Each interview was approximately 45 minutes, in-person or through video. The topics covered were specific to each interviewee’s department and area of expertise.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	    <p><strong>Affinity Mapping</strong></p>
	    <p>With results from the stakeholder interviews, we then moved on to an affinity mapping exercise. This activity produces a physical, tactile and editable design artifact that helps us visualize common trends, themes, areas of opportunity and improvements.</p>
	    <img src="images/kinetic/affinitymap.png">

	    <ul>
	    	<li>High quality photography is crucial to show products’ context in a home</li>
	    	<li>Arcadia Custom’s brand values speak to their excellence in product innovation</li>
	    	<li>Arcadia Custom’s digital ambitions go beyond a visually redesigned website</li>
	    	<li>Raising the brand perception of Arcadia Custom is a top priority</li>
	    	<li>The product quality of Arcadia Custom is unmatched by competitors</li>
	    	<li>Interviewees were inspired by other great brands (Nike, Restoration Hardware, Tesla etc.)</li>
	    	<li>It’s important that we address the needs of all of our persona groups</li>
	    </ul>

	    <p>For each of the key themes, we thought of ‘How Might We…’ (HMW) questions to help us align with the business needs.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
	    <p><strong>Personas</strong></p>
	    <p>To better inform our design decisions and build empathy for our users, we synthesized stakeholder interviews to create the following personas:</p>
	    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_overview.png">
	    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_1.png">
	    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_2.png">
	    <button>View More</button>
	</div>


	<div class="section">
	    <p><strong>Journey Mapping</strong></p>
	    <p>In order to create a personalized experience, we needed to fully understand how each persona interacts with one another. To do so, we created user journeys for each persona then consolidated them into one user journey map. This helped surface overlapping pain points that we would later address in our designs.</p>
