                <p><strong>Auditors</strong> require a “self-service” tool where they can run analytics without help from a data specialist. In the current state, a majority of their workflow requires specialist intervention. The back and forth communication required with another team delays their ability to complete reports.</p>

<!-- Our Approach -->

<img style="width: 100%" src="images/cortex/Approach.png">

<!-- Research -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Research</h2><hr>
    <p>At the start of the project, we participated in a <span class="highlight">2-Day Design Thinking Session (DTS)</span> to understand the current state of Cortex. After an extensive walkthrough, it was clear that we needed to work with a UX research team to gather feedback from Cortex users and establish our Design North Star.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <p>In total, we interviewed <span class="highlight">13 technology leaders, audit practitioners & data specialists to learn about their current process and pain points.</span> We also had a walkthrough of 4 audit applications to understand how Cortex fits into an auditor’s day-to-day workflow.</p><br>
<!--     <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Interview.png"> -->

    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>There was a positive outlook towards the future of Cortex</li>
        <li>Opportunity to make data acquisition more efficient</li>
        <li>We need <span class="highlight">two separate experiences for auditors and specialists</span>, each with very different needs</li>
        <li>A new relaunch with improved features show help adoption and understanding</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>We synthesized results from our interviews to create personas for Small Client Auditor, Large Client Auditor and Data Specialist. Examples of Small Client Auditor and Data Specialist personas are shown below.</p>
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Persona_1.png">
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Persona_2.png">
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p>In order to create a personalized experience for Nicky, we needed to fully understand the breadth and depth of her work. To do so, <span class="highlight">we mapped our her experience while completing her daily activities to understand her process and pain points.</span></p>
        <br>
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Planning is the most important phase of the process, auditors don't know what data they should be asking their clients for or what they can do with the data once it's received</li>
        <li>It isn't obvious where to go in Cortex</li>
        <li>Expectations around what the system should be able to do with data</li>
    </ul>
</div><br>

<br><br><br>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Heuristics Analysis</h3>
    <p>To understand whether Cortex is following <span class="highlight">predefined design principles (heuristics), we tested the "Create Standard Analytics" flow for Nicky's persona based on the following: funnel design, information design, interaction design, visual design, content & accessibility.</span></p><br>
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Heuristics.png">
    <br><br>
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Majority of flows require specialist intervention, self-service model would be most impactful for small teams with fewer resources</li>
        <li>Established Deloitte tools are available and preffered by auditors and data specialists</li>
        <li>Cortex doest not have clearly defined flows optimized for self-service model</li>
        <li>More education around the benefits of analytics and process</li>
    </ul>

<!-- UX/UI Design -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">UX/UI Design</h2><hr>
    <p><span class="highlight">The design stream was divided into 2 phases. There were 2 weeks between Phases for testing and iterations.</span> In Phase 1, we laid the foundation for the high impact areas including; navigation, homepage and analytics. In Phase 2, we moved into data management and audit-specific tests.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Defining the Ideal Workflow</h3>
    <p>After prioritizing epics by their level of impact, I started working on a task flow to map out what the most ideal workflow would look like for an auditor. This required a lot of collaboration with the team and later served as a guide during the low fidelity phase. </p>
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Task_flow.png">
</div>
<br>
<div class="section">
    <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
    <p>During the low fidelity phase, I created sketches and gray-scale components using the internal Omnia Design System. The product team was open to introducing new components specific to the needs of Cortex.
</p>
</div><br>

<img style="width: 100%"  src="images/cortex/Lo-Fi.png"><br><br>

<div class="section">
    <h3>High Fidelity Designs</h3>
    <p>The design team worked on high fidelity designs as low fidelity wireframes were approved, creating a streamlined process. <span class="highlight">We established a unique color palette and UI patterns for Cortex while maintaining visual cohesiveness to the Omnia brand.</span></p>
</div><br>

<img style="width: 100%" src= "images/cortex/Hi-Fi.png"/>

<div class="section">
    <h3>User Testing & Iterations</h3>
    <p>At the end of each Phase, the Deloitte Digital team tested designs with users. Results from user testing carried over to design as we continued to iterate.</p>

<!-- Implementation -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Implementation</h2><hr>
    <p>I worked closely with 6 Product teams to build <span class="highlight">Prism Design System for Cortex, establish internal processes and guide implementation.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Introducing Prism Design System</h3>
    <p>Cortex is part of a suite of applications under the Omnia brand. At the time, Omnia’s Design System was not yet built for use. <span class="highlight">To meet the launch date for Cortex, we decided to create a hybrid design system using a combination of components from Omnia and new components introduced during the redesign.</span> I took on this challenge by creating design system files in Figma to bridge the gap between development and the new redesign screens.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Addressing UI Inconsistencies Across Global teams</h3>
    <p>We encountered many UI inconsistencies while working with global teams. Specifically for Journal Entry (JE) Testing where there were 12 tests that follow a similar layout. The 2 development teams implementing these pages were working through very quickly. However, they were not reusing styles that had already been developed.</p><br>

    <p>I arranged a call with 2 POs and their development teams to emphasize the importance of UI consistency.</p><br>

    <p><strong>During the conversation, we learned that:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Developers did not know how to use the Inspect feature in Figma.</li>
            <li>2. Figma SSO error preventing developers from viewing designs.</li>
            <li>3. PMs needed more guidance with what to look out for while testing the UI.</li>
        </ol><br>
</div>

<div class="feature-section">

        <div class="feature-section-content">

            <p>This provided clear action items for me to proceed 1) I gave a live demo of Figma Inspect, 2) I escalated the SSO issue with Senior Managers, 3) I created UI clean up document detailing the styles that needed change, and 4) created spacing guidelines for Azure DevOps tickets to make styles more consistent moving forward.</p><br>

            <p>In a few short weeks, there was a <span class="highlight">significant improvement in the consistency between pages in JE testing. Development teams were more effective in reusing code and collaborating with designers.</span></p>
                
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>


<div class="section">
    <h3>Continuous Iteration</h3>
    <p>As the lead designer across product teams, I worked with the Senior Manager to prioritize and assign tasks to the Design team. I had the opportunity to shape internal team processes while working on high priority flows needed for Cortex. I balanced redesign work with continuous iteration from user testing and requests from development.</p>
