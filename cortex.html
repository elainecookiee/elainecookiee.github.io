        <p>Deloitte Global came to us to help them re-envision the audit experience for an existing application. They wanted a simple-to-use interface that enabled audit teams to run complex analyses and generate visualizations for their clients.</p>

<!-- Our Approach -->

<div class="section">
    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <img src="images/kinetic/Approach1.png">
</div>


<!-- Research -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Research</h2>
    <p>In preparation for the Design Thinking Session (DTS), we had a 2-Week Research & Discovery Phase to understand the current competitive landscape, conduct interviews, create personas, user journeys and gather inspiration.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>On-Site Visit</h3>
    <p>Arcadia Custom has a network of over 140 high-end window and door dealers across the nation. A few members of our New York team had the opportunity to visit a facility in Stamford to conduct interviews.</p>
    <img src="images/kinetic/Onsite2.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customers are sold on Arcadia Custom products before they come in by recommendations from pre-qualified architects and builders</li>
        <li>Customers immediately feel the value of the product upon touching it. They are always impressed with the build quality and weight. They are not price sensitive, they just want the best visual and design</li>
        <li>Every Arcadia Custom product is made to the specs of the house it will be installed in. Most of their competitors have standard sizes that architects/builders have to work around (24” x 36”)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>To better understand the competitive space, we examined how direct competitors met the needs of homeowners and professionals looking to use their products. Specifically taking note of the information architecture (overall ease of navigation), products (product detail page and specs) and process (inspiration gallery).</p>
    <img src="images/kinetic/Competitors_All.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Stakeholder Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h3>
     <p>To gather insight from internal teams, we conducted 7 interviews with stakeholders across Arcadia Custom and DMC Global. Each interview was approximately 45 minutes, in-person or through video. The topics covered were specific to each interviewee’s department and area of expertise.</p></br>
     <p>With results from the stakeholder interviews, we then moved on to an affinity mapping exercise. This activity produces a physical, tactile and editable design artifact that helps us visualize common trends, themes, areas of opportunity and improvements.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>To better inform our design decisions and build empathy for our users, we synthesized stakeholder interviews to create the following personas:</p>
    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_overview.png">
    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_1.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p>In order to create a personalized experience, we needed to fully understand how each persona interacts with one another. To do so, we created user journeys for each persona then consolidated them into one user journey map. This helped surface overlapping pain points that we would later address in our designs.</p>

<!-- Design Thinking Session -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Design Thinking Session</h2>
    <p>After the Research & Discovery phase, I met the project team and clients in New York for a full-day Design Thinking Session (DTS). The session ran from 9am to 4pm with lunch and breaks provided. Our objective was to walk our clients through the current landscape, themes that had been synthesized from the stakeholder interviews and run through activities that would help generate user stories. These user stories would then be used for epics, requirements and designs.</p></br>
    <p>My role in the DTS was to participate in user story generation and lead the final activity, the inspiration session.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
     <h3>Inspiration Session (60 min)</h3>
     <p>The final activity of the day was the inspiration session. Our objective was to get the team excited about future designs and provide visual guidance for the design phase.</p></br>
     <p>We started the activity by having each client walk through 1-2 pieces of inspiration they had prepared and why they selected them. For the rest of the activity, we structured our conversation around 3 key themes. Each theme had 3-5 contrasting examples that approached the problem in different ways.</p></br>
     <p><strong>The themes we selected were:</strong></p>
     <img src="images/kinetic/inspiration.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drawn to Photography websites - large, high-quality images and bold text headings</li>
        <li>Showcasing products from different views / angles / within context of a designed space</li>
        <li>Likes dynamic movement, more modern and visually compelling</li>
        <li>Dislikes lifestyle imagery, feel like humans take away from a high-end site experience</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<!-- UX/UI Phase -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">UX/UI Phase</h2>
    <p>After the DTS, we began a 10-week UX/UI Design Phase. The strategy team quickly got started on synthesizing results into epics and requirements while design began low-fidelity. We had client demos every 2 weeks to get feedback and approval. While working on lo-fis, we also prepared interactive prototypes for usability testing and iterated on feedback.</p></br>
    <p>In total, we designed 12 responsive page templates for desktop and mobile.</p>
</div>

<!-- LO-FI -->

<div class="section">
     <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes (Sprint 1-3)</h3>
     <p>The team worked on lo-fis based epics with the greatest impact for our users. For each epic, we created persona-specific user stories that were approved by stakeholders.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>First Project using AEM Core Components</strong></p>
    <p>Core components is an internal library built by the Konrad team. It is intended to be used as building blocks for standard marketing and informational sites. Since both projects were working in parallel, our team relied on core components as they were being defined. There was no onboarding process, files, guidelines and written documentation were incomplete which made it difficult to use the library.</p></br>
    <p>As a result, we worked closely with the AEM team to push core components to their limits - creating a more flexible and robust system of components.</p>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>Defining Brand Assets - Color, Typography & Iconography</strong></p>
    <p>The clients took it upon themselves to define brand guidelines with an external team. What we received did not capture the luxious brand they were looking to achieve. We took it on ourselves to introduce a new color palette, typography and branding system to get their brand to the next level.</p></br>
    <p><strong>Client Suggested Assets (Left)</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Four brand colors were provided in google docs (including black #000 and white #fff)</li>
        <li>Colors pairings did not pass AA accessibility (below 3 color contrast)</li>
        <li>Color palette & typography selection did not align with a luxury brand, felt more like corporate, tech or healthcare</li>
        <li>No guidelines provided (Do’s and Don’ts)</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>Storytelling with Imagery</strong></p>
    <p>A key factor for why some photographic sites work well comes down to the imagery selected. Each image needs to be carefully selected to reflect the brand pillars and overall visual direction - For Arcadia Custom this would be imagery that alludes to our high-end, luxury, premium products. </p>
