<!-- Our Approach -->


<!-- Research -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Research</h2><hr>
    <p>At the start of the project, we participated in a <span class="highlight">2-Day Design Thinking Session (DTS)</span> to understand the current state of Cortex. After an extensive walkthrough, it was clear that we needed to work with a UX research team to gather feedback from Cortex users and establish our Design North Star.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>User Interviews</h3>
    <p>In total, we interviewed <span class="highlight">13 technology leaders, audit practitioners & data specialists to learn about their current process and pain points.</span> We also had a walkthrough of 4 audit applications to understand how Cortex fits into an auditor’s day-to-day workflow.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>There was a positive outlook towards the future of Cortex</li>
        <li>Opportunity to make data acquisition more efficient</li>
        <li>We need <span class="highlight">two separate experiences for auditors and specialists</span>, each with very different needs</li>
        <li>A new relaunch with improved features show help adoption and understanding</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Heuristics Analysis</h3>
    <p>To understand whether Cortex is following predefined design principles (heuristics), we tested the "Create Standard Analytics" flow based on the following: funnel design, information design, interaction design, visual design, content & accessibility.</p>
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Heuristics.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>We synthesized results from our interviews and heuristics analysis to create personas for Small Client Auditor, Large Client Auditor and Data Specialist. Examples of Small Client Auditor and Data Specialist personas are shown below.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p>In order to create a personalized experience for Nicky, we needed to fully understand the breadth and depth of her work. To do so, we mapped our her experience while completing her daily activities to understand her process and pain points.</p>

<!-- UX/UI Design -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">UX/UI Design</h2><hr>
    <p>The design stream was divided into 2 phases with additional design resources from Deloitte Digital. In Phase 1, we laid the foundation for the high impact areas including; navigation, homepage and analytics. In Phase 2, we moved into data management and audit-specific tests. Each phase lasted 3 months. There were 2 weeks between Phases for testing and iterations.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Defining the Ideal Workflow</h3>
    <p>After prioritizing epics by their level of impact, I started working on a task flow to map out what the most ideal workflow would look like for an auditor. This required a lot of collaboration with the team and later served as a guide during the low fidelity phase. </p>
    <img class="round-corners" src="images/cortex/Task_flow.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
    <p>During the low fidelity phase, I created sketches and gray-scale components using the internal Omnia Design System. The product team was open to introducing new components specific to the needs of Cortex.
</p>
    <!-- <img src="images/kinetic/Onsite2.png"> -->
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>High Fidelity Designs</h3>
    <p>The design team worked on high fidelity designs as low fidelity wireframes were approved, creating a streamlined process. We established a unique color palette and UI patterns for Cortex while maintaining visual cohesiveness to the Omnia brand.</p>
    <!-- <img src="images/kinetic/Onsite2.png"> -->
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Evaluate</h3>
    <p>At the end of each Phase, the Deloitte Digital team tested designs with users. Results from user testing carried over to design as we continued to iterate.</p>

<!-- Implementation -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Implementation</h2><hr>
    <p>I worked closely with 6 Product teams to build Prism Design System for Cortex, establish internal processes and guide implementation processes. Before having a designated designer, the development teams were building from screenshots of components. I helped the team establish a scalable system for moving designs to development.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Introducing Prism Design System</h3>
    <p>Cortex is part of a suite of applications under the Omnia brand. At the time, Omnia’s Design System was not yet built for use. To meet the launch date for Cortex, we decided to create a hybrid design system using a combination of components from Omnia and new components introduced during the redesign. I took on this challenge by creating design system files in Figma to bridge the gap between development and the new redesign screens.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Addressing UI Inconsistencies Across Global teams</h3>
    <p>Cortex is part of a suite of applications under the Omnia brand. The purpose of the Omnia brand is to have one design system that encompasses the entire suite of applications. However, the Omnia design system is still in the process of being</p>
