                <h1>MY ROLE</h1>
                <p>I led the ideation and design of the split screen game and interactive mat controller September to December 2016.</p>
                <p><strong>Common Goal and Ideation:</strong> I worked with a graphic designer for this project. We were both interested in creating a technology that would make physical activity more fun and engaging for beginners.</p>
                <p><strong>Planning and Scope Definition:</strong> The project required a proposal, alpha preview, presentation, final write-up and a gitHub tutorial. For this project, I took on the role as Project Manager -kept record of the ideation process and sketches. I created the documentation and framework for each of the write-ups and presentation.</p>

                <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
                <h1>IDEATION AND FEASIBILITY</h1>
                <p>For our first tech studio design project, we had time, resources and a lot of great technology to use. Our challenge was building a proof of concept and the project flow.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Makey Makey Classic, aluminum foil tape, conductive thread, LED lights, wires, alligator clips</p>
            </div>
            <div class= 'section'>
                <h2>THE APPROACH</h2>
                <h1>BUILDING SIMULTANEOUSLY</h1>
                <p>We built a paper prototype of the mat with foil tape and conductive thread. This would ensure that keypress events and LED lights worked the way we wanted before having it transferred to the working prototype.</p>
                <p>For the game, we animated on the HTML5 Canvas with the zim.js and EaselJS external libraries.</p>
                <p><strong>Core Purpose:</strong> Motivate	people	to	get	up	and	move by	using	their	feet	to	control	the	game</p>

                <h1>THE DISCOVERY</h1>

                <h1>STUMBLES -Fail Fast Fail Early</h1>
                <p>Some difficulties we encountered during the process:</p>
                <p><strong>// Changing our idea after proposal submission</strong></p>
                <p>We initially wanted to create a Yoga tutorial with an interactive mat and visualization display that would activate in response to performing a correct pose. However, this would entail difficulties with having to sync four components. We decided that we would still be able to promote physical activity with just the interactive mat by adding in a game.</p>
                <img class="casestudy" src= "images/ft_yoga.png" width= "50%"/>
                <p><strong>// The Arduino VS. Makey Makey.</strong></p>
                <p>Using Arduinos for keypress events would require an extra usb keyboard. We decided to use the Makey Makey board instead for its durability.</p>
                <p><strong>// The V1.2 and the Classic.</strong></p>
                <p>The new interface for V1.2 made the remapping process a lot simpler. However, the tutorials we needed for connecting the Makey Makey board to LED lights were for the Classic version. We decided to remap the Classic version by modifying the code using an Arduino IDE Firmware.</p>
                <img class="casestudy" src= "images/ft_makey.png" width= "50%"/>
                <p><strong>// Connecting multiple lights</strong></p>
                <p>After successfully connecting one light using pin D14, we tried to use D16 to connect to extra lights using the same method. However, D16 is defaulted to mouse events, which is not used in our case. We solved this problem by extending GND and D14 to an external breadboard so that we can connect to multiple lights instead of using different pins on one board.</p>
                <p>Game Design</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting random falling objects within four individual columns</li>
                    <li>Controlling the falling speed and time to manage the game difficulty</li>
                    <li>Objects staying on stage after falling, slowing down the game</li>
                    <li>Overlapping apples/pears with traps (rocks), hit test sometimes not working</li>
                    <li>Set capacity for score bar to progress to next level</li>
                </ul>

            </div>
            <div class= 'section'>
                <h1>VICTORIES</h1>
                <p>While researching conductive material, we went from pressure sensors to using foil tape and conductive thread which greatly expanded the area that players can use. It was also less costly and more durable than the other options we researched such as Velostat or conductive fabric.</p>
                <p>We got two LED lights to light up when extending keyboard pins into the breadboard.</p>
                <img class="casestudy" src= "images/ft_lights.png" width= "50%"/>
                <p>The design of the buttons were well thought out. All the seams from the threads were hidden by sewing within the mat material. The conductive thread created a path from each button to the center of the mat, which solved our concern with having too many wires.</p>
                <img class="casestudy" src= "images/ft_wires.png" width= "50%"/>
                <p>Extending the ‘ground’ of the Makey Makey by connecting alligator clips also did not seem to take away from the player’s experience.</p>

            <div class= 'section'>
                <h2>RELECTIONS</h2>
                <h1>WHAT I LEARNED</h1>
                <p>Building the game itself was a collaborative task. We would witness our game break over and over again but then we would see it start to work the way it should. We also created all of the assets for the game as we saw it come to life.</p>
