<!-- Research -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Research</h2><hr>
    <p>In preparation for the Design Thinking Session (DTS), we had a <span class="highlight">2-Week Research & Discovery Phase</span> to understand the current competitive landscape, conduct interviews, create personas, user journeys and gather inspiration.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>On-Site Visit</h3>
    <p>Arcadia Custom has a network of over 140 high-end window and door dealers across the nation. A few members of our New York team had the opportunity to visit a facility in Stamford to conduct interviews.</p>
    <img src="images/kinetic/Onsite2.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Customers are sold on Arcadia Custom products</span> before they come in by recommendations from pre-qualified architects and builders</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Customers immediately feel the value of the product upon touching it.</span> They are always impressed with the build quality and weight. They are not price sensitive, they just want the best visual and design</li>
        <li>Every Arcadia Custom product is <span class="highlight">made to the specs of the house it will be installed in.</span> Most of their competitors have standard sizes that architects/builders have to work around (24” x 36”)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>To better understand the competitive space, we examined how direct competitors met the needs of homeowners and professionals looking to use their products. Specifically taking note of the information architecture (overall ease of navigation), products (product detail page and specs) and process (inspiration gallery).</p>
    <img style="width: 80%; margin-left:10%;" src="images/kinetic/Competitors_All.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Top-level luxury brands in the window & door space lacked innovative, modern site experiences. We needed to lean on best practices and inspiration from brands at a lower level of luxury as well as parallel industries to craft an experience best suited for Arcadia Custom.</li>
    </ul>
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h3>Stakeholder Interviews & Affinity Mapping</h3>
     <p>To gather insight from internal teams, we conducted <span class="highlight">7 interviews with stakeholders across Arcadia Custom and DMC Global. Each interview was approximately 45 minutes, in-person or through video.</span> The topics covered were specific to each interviewee’s department and area of expertise.</p></br>
     <p>With results from the stakeholder interviews, we then moved on to an <span class="highlight">affinity mapping exercise.</span> This activity produces a physical, tactile and editable design artifact that helps us visualize common trends, themes, areas of opportunity and improvements.</p>
     <img src="images/kinetic/Stakeholder_interviews.png">
</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><strong>We learned that:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">High quality photography is crucial</span> to show products’ context in a home</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Raising the brand perception of Arcadia Custom is a top priority (luxury, quality and value)</li>
        <li>The product quality of Arcadia Custom is unmatched by competitors</li>
        <li>It’s important that we address the needs of all of our persona groups</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <p>To better inform our design decisions and build empathy for our users, we synthesized stakeholder interviews to create the following personas:</p>
    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_overview.png">
    <img src="images/kinetic/persona_1.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>After reviewing the personas with our clients</strong>, we adjusted Dealer David’s persona from secondary to primary - as dealer’s are highly valued for their product expertise and sales. <span class="highlight"> Making the three primary personas - Homeowner Hannah, Architect Adam and Dealer David.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Journey Mapping</h3>
    <p>In order to create a personalized experience, we needed to fully understand how each persona interacts with one another. To do so, we created user journeys for each persona then consolidated them into one user journey map. This helped surface overlapping pain points that we would later address in our designs.</p>

<!-- Design Thinking Session -->

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="design-process-title">Design Thinking Session</h2><hr>
    <p>After the Research & Discovery phase, I met the project team and clients in New York for a full-day Design Thinking Session (DTS). The session ran from 9am to 4pm with lunch and breaks provided. <span class="highlight">Our objective was to walk our clients through the current landscape, themes that had been synthesized from the stakeholder interviews and run through activities that would help generate user stories.</span> These user stories would then be used for epics, requirements and designs.</p></br>
    <p><span class="highlight">My role in the DTS was to participate in user story generation and lead the final activity, the inspiration session.</span></p>

    <p>After the DTS, we began a 10-week UX/UI Design Phase. The Strategy team quickly got started on synthesizing results into epics and requirements while the Design team began low-fidelity. We had <span class="highlight">client demos every 2 weeks to get feedback and approval.

    <p><strong>Defining Brand Assets - Color, Typography & Iconography</strong></p>
    <p>The clients took it upon themselves to define brand guidelines with an external team. <span class="highlight">What we received did <strong>not</strong> capture the luxurious brand they were looking to achieve. We took it on ourselves to introduce a new color palette, typography and branding system take their brand to the next level.</span></p></br>

    <ul>
        <li>Four brand colors were provided in google docs (including black #000 and white #fff)</li>
        <li>Colors pairings did not pass AA accessibility (below 3 color contrast)</li>
        <li>Color palette & typography did not align with a luxury brand, felt more like corporate, tech or healthcare</li>
        <li>No guidelines provided (Do’s and Don’ts)</li>

    <p><strong>Storytelling with Imagery</strong></p>
    <p>A key factor for why some photographic sites work well comes down to the imagery selected. Each image needs to be carefully selected to reflect the brand pillars and overall visual direction - For Arcadia Custom this would be imagery that alludes to our high-end, luxury, premium products. </p>

    <p>Towards the end of the 10-Week design phase, I created an implementation file documenting key flows to ensure that the development team had everything they needed to get started. I also created authoring guidelines for the client for how to select imagery, aspect ratios, character counts… etc.</p>
