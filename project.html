        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>‘My Brand kit’ is a one-click branding feature on Venngage that allows you to apply your logo and brand colour(s) to any design that you create. This feature uses a colour-matching algorithm where you can click through to see various combinations of your brand.</p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>The goal is to redesign the current brand experience in the Venngage editor to help users complete their branded designs faster. Research has shown that users who are successful at creating branded designs are more likely to retain.</p>

    <h4>Our Approach</h4>
        <p>First, I went through the user flow to understand how the existing brand feature works. Users with the business plan have full access to the ‘My Brand’ page. On this page they can add in their logos, brand colours and fonts in order access them later while they are working on their designs.</p>
        <p>After going through the flow, it was clear that the brand application process was very manual. Users had to select and colour one element at a time. The brand logos, colours and fonts were hidden in different menu locations. There was nothing in the editor to indicate how these brand assets can be used.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <hr>

    <div>
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>Questions: What do existing tools offer for branding? How do we differentiate?</p>
        <p>Tools in the market generate personalized template packages (letterheads, business cards, presentations etc.) based on logos, colours and font input. However, for a tool with hundreds of custom designed graphics —flexibility and customization are key.</p>

    <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p>Questions: Questions: What are users creating with the current brand feature? What do successful templates look like?</p>
        <p>User calls are important when you are making significant changes to an existing feature. Here I spoke with business users who have used ‘My Brand’ to learn about their goals, expectations and what this feature helps them achieve.</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Data</h4>
        <p>Next, I worked with a designer and developer to see how users interact with the ‘My Brand’ page. Specifically, how many colours users added and the combination of colours they used.</p>
        <p>The data showed that half of the sample of users added between 1–4 brand colours. There was also a significant number of users who didn’t add any colours and fair amount of users who added twelve colours!</p>

    <h4>Quantitative Data</h4>
        <p>Combining the quantitative data with the qualitative data was where I got to see how people actually use brand colours in their designs.</p>
        <p>Below are examples of brand colours added by our users. With this data, I was able to compare the designs that our users created with the colours they add to their brand.</p>
        <ul class="list-styling">
            <li>Generally, users who added more brand colours were more successful and were more likely to duplicate their designs to use again.</li>
